# Smart-Water-Quality-Auto-Treatment-System
This project presents a smart water quality monitoring system using Arduino Uno. It measures pH, TDS, and temperature in real time and displays the data on an OLED screen. The system automatically detects unsafe water, activates purification, and sends alerts via ESP32 for remote monitoring.
